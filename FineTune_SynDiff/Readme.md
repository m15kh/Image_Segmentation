# FineTune SynDiff

This repository contains the fine-tuning implementation for [SynDiff](https://github.com/icon-lab/SynDiff), a framework for image segmentation.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to fine-tune the SynDiff model for specific image segmentation tasks. SynDiff provides a robust foundation for segmentation, and this repository extends its capabilities for customized datasets.

## Features

- Fine-tuning SynDiff for domain-specific segmentation tasks.
- Support for custom datasets.
- Easy integration with the original SynDiff framework.

## Getting Started

1. Update system packages and install build dependencies:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install ninja-build
    ```

2. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/icon-lab/SynDiff.git
    cd SynDiff
    ```

3. Install Python requirements:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Follow the instructions in this repository to set up the fine-tuning process.
