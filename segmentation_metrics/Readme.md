# Segmentation Metrics

This repository contains implementations of famous metrics for evaluating segmentation performance in computer vision and machine learning tasks. These metrics help quantify how well a segmentation algorithm performs compared to ground truth.

## Included Metrics

- **Pixel Accuracy**: Percentage of pixels correctly classified  
- **Intersection over Union (IoU)**: Also known as Jaccard index  
- **Dice Coefficient**: Measures overlap between two samples  
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall  
- **Precision & Recall**: Basic evaluation metrics for classification tasks  
- **Specificity**: True negative rate  
- **Sensitivity**: True positive rate (same as recall)  
- **Hausdorff Distance**: Measures the maximum distance between two segmentation boundaries  

## Purpose

This library provides efficient implementations of these metrics to help researchers and developers evaluate and compare different segmentation algorithms. The implementations are optimized for both accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Usage

Examples and documentation for using these metrics will be added soon.
