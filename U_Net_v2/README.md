# U-Net Segmentation Model

## Overview

This repository contains implementation of a U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation tasks. The model is designed to process images and produce segmentation masks for character recognition


## Usage

- For training, go to `src/` and run `train.py`.
- For inference, go to `src/` and run `inference.py`.
- To set parameters such as paths for images, masks, and other configurations, update the YAML files in the `params/` folder.
